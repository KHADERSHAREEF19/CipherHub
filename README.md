## Introduction

**Cipher Hub** is a user-friendly file encryption tool designed for everyone. Its mission is to provide privacy and peace of mind by making high-grade encryption accessible without requiring technical expertise.

The most important feature of Cipher Hub is its **on-device security model**. Unlike other services that require you to upload your files, all encryption and decryption processes happen directly within your browser. Your files are never transmitted, never stored, and never seen by us. You hold the keys, and you have total control.

## How It Works

Using Cipher Hub is as easy as 1-2-3. Here's how you can secure and restore your files in a few simple steps.

### To Encrypt a File 🔐

1.  **Navigate to the Dashboard** from the home page.
2.  **Select Your File** by dragging and dropping it into the "Encrypt" panel or by clicking to browse your computer.
3.  **Click "Encrypt File"**. The app will process your file instantly on your device.
4.  **Save Your Key!** A unique encryption key will be generated. This is **extremely important**. Copy this key and save it in a secure place (like a password manager). **If you lose this key, your file cannot be recovered.**
5.  **Download Your File.** Click the "Download Encrypted File" button. Your new, secure file will be saved to your computer with a `.encrypted` extension.

### To Decrypt a File 🔑

1.  **Select the Encrypted File.** On the Dashboard, switch to the "Decrypt" panel. Drag and drop your `.encrypted` file or click to select it.
2.  **Enter Your Key.** Paste the unique encryption key you saved earlier into the "Encryption Key" text box.
3.  **Click "Decrypt File"**.
4.  **Download Your Original File.** The app will restore your file. Click the "Download Decrypted File" button to save it back to your computer in its original format.
